        <li>and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>

        <li>¾ cup Italian-style panko bread crumbs</li>

        <li>⅓ cup grated Romano cheese</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>

        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley</li>

        <li>4 large lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br/> 
        Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p> </li>
        
        <li><p>Lightly season each side of the chicken with salt and pepper.<br/> 
        Add flour to a shallow dish. Whisk eggs and water together in a second dish.<br/> 
        Combine panko bread crumbs, Romano cheese, lemon zest, oregano, garlic powder, <br/>
        salt, and pepper in a third shallow dish.. 
        </p></li>
        
        <li><p>Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then dredge each chicken cutlet in the <br/>
        flour, shaking off excess. Dip cutlets into the egg wash, allowing excess to drip off,<br/>
        and, finally, dredge in the bread crumbs, pressing down on each side so breading sticks
        </p></li>
        
        <li><p>Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add breaded<br/>
        chicken cutlets and cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is crispy and starts to turn <br/>
        golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip cutlets, and cook for another 2 minutes. 

        </p></li>

        <li><p>Transfer cutlets to the baking sheet, and evenly sprinkle each with mozzarella<br/> 
            cheese.

        </p></li>

        <li><p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear,<br/>
            6 to 8 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 <br/>
            degrees F (74 degrees C). Do not overcook. 
        </p></li>

        <li><p>Remove from the oven, garnish with parsley, and serve with lemon wedges for spritzing. 

        </p></li>
